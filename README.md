# DimensionReduction_LinearClassification_Kather

The data were downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/colorectal-histology-mnist?resource=download

The dimension reduction method used here includes PCA, LDA and PCA+LDA.

The classification used here includes KNN, minimum Mahalanobis distance classifier and softmax classifier. 

The highest classification accuracy result in test set I got is around 76%.

There are no data preprocessing and no image augmentation in this code (in fact I tried, but there is no improvement in the performance).

To improve the performance, you may use more comlex classifier.
